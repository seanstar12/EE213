###Project 2
======
Using assembly, this project creates a binary counter that divides by 16. The code uses
a speaker to beep out the number of times the pressed amount is divisible by 16 and outputs
the remainder in binary to the onboard LEDs E.g. ButtonPresses= 35 --> beeps twice and shows
3 in binary.

###Creative Component
======
Since this was trivial, the project also plays a song when a different button is pressed. Also
3 seven segment displays were used to display the numeric output. These were wired in parallel 
and BJTs were used to control the path to ground due to the limited number of pins.
