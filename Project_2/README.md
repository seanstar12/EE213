###Project 2
======
Using assembly, this project creates a binary counter that divides by 16. The code uses
a speaker to beep out the number of times the pressed amount is divisible by 16 and outputs
the remainder in binary to the onboard LEDs E.g. ButtonPresses= 35 --> beeps twice and shows
3 in binary.

###Creative Component
======
Since this was trivial, the project also plays a song when a different button is pressed.
